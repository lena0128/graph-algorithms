# Graph
Graph is a collection of nodes and edges. 
* nodes - could be visualized as circles with some data inside of them
* edges - connections between nodes
<br />

* directed graph
* undirected graph
<br />

### Adjacency List
Adjacency list is a preferred way to represent graph information. Typically, we would use some hash map data structure to represent an adjacency list.

## What Does Traversal Mean in Coding?
Traversing a data structure means: "visiting" or "touching" the elements of the structure, and doing something with the data. 
<br />
Traversing is also sometimes called `iterating` over the data structure.

### Depth First Traversal - Stack (Last in, first out)
Exploring one direction as far as possible before switching directions. 

### Breadth First Traversal - Queue (First in, first out)
The breadth first traversal tends to explore all directions EVENLY, instead of just favoring one direction all the way through.
